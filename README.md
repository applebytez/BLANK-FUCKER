# BLANK Fucker
A tool to dump webhooks from blank grabber payloads to be able to spam and delete them<br><br>
**As of September 5, 2023... supports ALL versions of blank grabber.**

# This project is now closed
Since blank grabber has died, we have also stopped supporting it. The new 'owner' is an even bigger script kiddie who can't write a single function or feature or any sort of bypass against our tool. Safe to say, we will probably not need to make a single change to support blank grabber for a while. 

**I am keeping it un-archived incase ANY retards who currently work on blank grabber think of fucking about.**

# What is blank grabber?
Blank grabber is a malicious tool used to be able to steal credentials of primarily discord users.
Blank grabber is advertised with the following beautiful features

Now these don't seem very nice to me..

# Why?
I found this malicious payload being used in roblox discord servers to prey on innocent kids trying to get applications to trade for them in their favorite game. It wasn't even as if this software was used to scam scammers, it was just used to steal the credentials of a poor 12 year old in the wrong place at the wrong time.

# Also

After seeing what I can almost call disgusting issue by the owner, almost as if he's saying "Haha kid. fuck you, go cry to mommy" I decided to investigate. The owner of this repo doesn't seem to be creating this for educational purposes, rather as a way to get his name out to interested scammers who wish to prey on little kids.

# Ontop of all of this

The owner seems to have users wanting to bypass antivirus, and he seems to wish to be able to do it himself, if he wasn't such a terrible script kiddie... maybe he could?

Again, this isn't being used for "educational purposes". The owner himself blatantly acts like it's not... which honestly... first time I've seen that.

And then finally, this absolutely disgusting issue was opened, which lead me to making this entire dumper

Now the owner and users are targetting roblox players, who are mostly children.

Disgusting, and motivation.

# How to use & install
- For extracting pyc from exe, this uses pyinstractor. Half of the code is basically just that.
- For decompiling, you need to have pre-compiled pycdas in the working python directory.
- Finally, name the malware application 'grabber.exe'. This will allow the tool to automatically identify everything it needs to, and get your result faster.

# Ending notes
If you make your malware, atleast don't be an asshole about it, don't openly help your obvious scammers. Usually people who make malwares make it to better the antivirus world, and show new methods of bypassing X, Y, and Z. Instead, this is just pasted code thrown about, with the most laughable attempt at "obfuscation". Might as well call btoa("js-code") obfuscation and then eval(atob("obf-string")) because that is practically what this owner does. 

I'm tired of people supporting roblox scammers, preying on innocent children is just the worst. And may I remind you again, this payload was found in a roblox discord.
